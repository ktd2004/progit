"So far, I’ve covered the basics of how Git works and how to use it, and I’ve "
"introduced a number of tools that Git provides to help you use it easily "
"and efficiently. In this chapter, I’ll go through some operations that you "
"can use to make Git operate in a more customized fashion by introducing "
"several important configuration settings and the hooks system. With these "
"tools, it’s easy to get Git to work exactly the way you, your company, or "
"your group needs it to."

"You saw some simple Git configuration details in the first chapter, but I’ll "

"to determine non-default behavior that you may want. The first place Git "

"for every user on the system and all of their repositories. If you pass the "

"Finally, Git looks for configuration values in the config file in the Git "

"These values are specific to that single repository. Each level overwrites "
"values in the previous level, so values in `.git/config` trump those in "
"`/etc/gitconfig`, for instance. You can also set these values by manually "
"editing the file and inserting the correct syntax, but it’s generally easier "
